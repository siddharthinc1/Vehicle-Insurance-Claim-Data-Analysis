# Vehicle Insurance Claim Data Analysis

## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze insurance claim data to identify patterns and trends that affect claim amounts. The project focuses on examining vehicle, injury, and property claims, as well as understanding how demographic factors such as age and gender impact claim amounts. These insights aim to facilitate informed decision-making within the organization.

## Contributions
- I contributed as a data analyst, where my responsibilities included:
  - **Data Collection**: Collected and compiled data from sources such as Kaggle.
  - **Data Cleaning**: Pre-processed data to ensure reliability by handling missing values and fixing inconsistencies.
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted EDA to uncover trends, summary statistics, and outliers in the data.
  - **Data Visualization**: Generated charts and interactive dashboards using **Tableau**, **Power BI**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib** to present findings to stakeholders.
  - This project helped me further develop my skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Data Analysis**: Numpy
- **Data Cleaning**: Pandas, Excel
- **Statistical Analysis**: Five number summary, hypothesis testing
- **Data Visualization**: Power BI, Tableau, Seaborn, Matplotlib

## Data Source
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle's publicly available insurance claim data.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing data and corrected inconsistencies to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis.
   - Achieved a high data quality standard through thorough preprocessing.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Generated summary statistics, such as mean claim amounts by demographic factors.
   - Identified correlations between age, gender, and claim amounts.
   - Explored different types of claims (vehicle, injury, and property) and their respective distributions.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Created visualizations to communicate key findings:
     - Distribution of claim amounts by age group.
     - Comparison of injury vs. vehicle claims across different demographics.
   - Developed interactive dashboards in Power BI and Tableau for easier interpretation.

## Key Insights
- **Age and Gender Influence**: Found a clear correlation between age and the amount claimed, with differences noted between genders.
- **Vehicle and Injury Claims**: Discovered that vehicle claims tend to be higher in amount compared to injury claims, but injury claims occur more frequently.

## Visualizations
- **Claim Amount by Age**: A visualization of how claim amounts vary across different age groups.
- **Vehicle vs. Injury Claims**: A comparative analysis of the frequency and amount of vehicle vs. injury claims.

## Conclusion
This project reinforced the importance of data-driven decision-making and helped stakeholders identify key factors influencing insurance claims. My work on this project emphasized the value of thorough data analysis and visualization to support business decisions.
